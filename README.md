# CorePractice

Hi Kenny,

Please find my technical test in this repository.

I hope you can see how I would go about structuring a solution and I approached it in a TDD fashion.

I probably took too much time writing out all the CRUD functions and this could be sped up with some code generation in future.

I also did have to look up how to do some of the EF code first DB generation as I had previously only done database driven Entity Framework work.

I will continue with a few more checkins to show you how I would approach some of the bonus points.

Thanks so much for the opportunity.

Kind regards,
Paul
